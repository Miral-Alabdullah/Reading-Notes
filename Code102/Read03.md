`id` element we use it after creating the embedded css in the html tags as an element in order to get the style that created and apply it on the html content. But, insted of creating an id for each element we can use `class`, it did the same job but without keep creating classes.


The `<header>` and `<footer>` elements can be used for:

+ The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

+ A header or footer for an individual `<article>` or `<section>` within the page.

## But!
_**What does that mean?**_ 
> The `header` and the `footer` both have an individual section in web page, like the **header** contains the title of the website, the main navigations and more. The **footer** contains the copyrights, the contacts information and more.  

> `<article>` Tag specifies independent, self-contained content. It shows like the latest news in the websites.

> `<section>` This tag divide the website and take a scetion to show a related content.

> `<div>` Difines a specific secion in the web page, it used as a container for HTML elements.

> `<!-- -->`  To add a comment in order to clarifiy your code without being visible to the users.

> `<nav>` It means the the block inside of it includes hyperlinks.
