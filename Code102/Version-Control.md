# What is Version Control (VCS) : 
A system which provides the ability to record the changes or the modifications that been applied on the file in order to revisit it anytime we want.

## The types of Version Control (VCS) and the differences between them :

Loval Version Control (**LVCS**) | Centralized Version Control (**CVCS**) | Distributed Version Control (**DVCS**)
-------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------
Ÿèntails one database on the hard disk that stores changes to files | A single server storing the changes and all clients can reach to it | Allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information (The main reason for it is because the if the CVCS goes down all the user will lose the capability of reaching the other's files and do any process on it)

## That is going to lead us to something we call it **_Git_** :
It is a **DVCS** that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. When you make a change on the file in Git you will be asking to commit to that change in order to keep the version of editing to revisit it again and again and those versions will protect the data from being lose. Also, Git relies a local operations to keep the ability for the others of reaching the files without using VPN for example.
