# The command line and the terminal:

A **command line, or terminal**, is a text-based interface to the system. Opening the terminal varies from one operating system to another. On the terminal you start with a prompt then that command is always the first thing you type and running these commands will give you an output.
There are two types of commands:

* Commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command.

* Commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.


There is a long list of commands like: *(pwd, Ls, clear, mkids,.. and more).* each one has a different method of use.

In Linux everything is a file, and for files their names followed by a dot symbol then *(2-3)* characters called an extension to identify their types from each other, for example **(File.txt).**

Also, there is a path for the file that leads you to the exact location of that specific file, for example **(E:\ASAC\102\Reading).**
