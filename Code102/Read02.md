# **GitHub** 

is the right place for software developers who want to improve their skills, share experiences and get a job. It is a platform to share your work and to interact with other's work. So, to interact with it you have to learn Mastering Markdown which is an easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

In another way, Markdown is manipulation in the way of showing the content, to style it the way you want.

*For example:* styling the text like make it bold, italic, and link it to any other website. Also, to make the text well-organized and clear you can create lists in different forms such as (ordered-lists with numbers, unordered-lists, or even sub-lists. Besides, embedding images, coding, and adding headers and quotes) in order to keep the structuring at a professional level.

To get those styles there are many symbols for that like (** ** or __ __) to make the text bold, (* * or _ _ ) and this one is to make it italic and so on.
