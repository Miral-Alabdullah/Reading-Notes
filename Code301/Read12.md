# SQL vs NoSQL

<br>
<br>

## Here are some differences between SQL and NoSQL DB:

<br>

| SQL                                                       | NoSQL                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------- |
| Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)             | Non-Relational Database                      |
| The data represented as rows and columns in form of table | Represented as key-value pairs in a document |
| Predefined schema                                         | Dynamic schema                               |
| good fit for the complex query                            | are not good fit for complex queries         |
| Examples:  MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL     | Examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb|

**1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

>> If the data is highly structured and the relations among the program entities are clearly defined.

**2. Give a real world example.**

>> Hospital management systemn. For example: the appointment for a surgery, the relation between the patient and the doctor, the oppitment, the surgery room and the bill.

**3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

>> Unstructured data. 

**4. Give a real world example.**

>> Data from social media analysis and websites.

**5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

>> NoSQL

**6. Which type of database is best for scalability?**

>> SQL

**1. What does SQL stand for?**

>> Structured query language.

**2. What is a realational database?**

>> A collection of data that represented as set of feilds and records, separated on multiple tables. Those tables (entities) have a relations that connect them, these relations could he **[ (one-to-one || (one-to-many) || (many-to-many) ]**.

**3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

>> The realational structure.

**4. What is a ‘schema’?**

>> A diagram that explains the whole Database, showing the entites, the columns and the relations between those entites.

**5. What is a NoSQL database?**

>> It's a non-structural database, build to store lots of data in a very efficient way.

**6. How does it work?**

>> A database contains a collections each one has a documents: looks more like JSON. You don't have to use the schema for the whole documents, they can be different. 

**7. What is inside of a Mongo database?**

>> Collections contains documents.

**8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

>> NoSQL, since there's no schema apllies and there's no relations, it's more easy to add more and new data.

>> Less relation merging, super and fast queries.

**9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

>> Having duplicate data.
