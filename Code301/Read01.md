**1. Component-Based Architecture :**

![Component-Based-Architecture!](https://www.hebergementwebs.com/image/f7/f7ff2ce429c26c468e6e16a6f3e9f7c8.jpg/component-based-architecture.jpg)

The picture above represents a **Component-Based Architecture**, which focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components.

* Modular.

* Portable.

* Replaceable.

* Reusable.

* Encapsulates its implementation.

* Exporting it as a higher-level interface.


**What is the component?** <cite>is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.</cite>

>> ### The benefits : 

>>> * Ease of development.

>>> * Reusable.

>>> * Reliability.

>>> * System maintenance evolution.

>>> * Independent.

> ### Views of a Component :

<br>

>> object-oriented view:

>>> <cite>A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation.</cite>

<br>


>> conventional view:

>>> <cite>It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic, the internal data structures that are required to implement the processing logic and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.</cite>


<br>

>> process-related view:

>>> <cite>The system is building from existing components maintained in a library. As the software architecture is formulated, components are selected from the library and used to populate the architecture.</cite>

**2. What is “Props” and how to use it in React?**

<br>

> React is a component-based library.

> is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.


**Using Props in React:**

**1.** Define an attribute and its value(data)
**2.** Pass it to child component(s) by using Props
**3.** Render the Props Data
