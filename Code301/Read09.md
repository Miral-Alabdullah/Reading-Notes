# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

<br>
<br>


**1. What is functional programming?**

>> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

**2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

>> It returns the same result if given the same arguments

>> It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).

>> It does not cause any observable side effects.

**3. What are the benefits of a pure function?**

>> It uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.

**4. What is immutability?**

>> When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

**5. What is Referential transparency?**

>> This pure function will always have the same output, given the same input.

<br>

**1. What is a module?**

>> It's like the component in the react app=> We split our back-end into modules to make it clear/readble and reusable.

**2. What does the word ‘require’ do?**

>> It requres either a library, package, framework, or module into pur app.

**3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

>> ``require(*module-path*)``

**4. What do we have to do to make a module available?**

>> ``module.expot``
