# HashTables 

- Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.

- It is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.


# Why do we use them?

  1- Hold unique values
  
  2- Dictionary
  
  3- Library


# What Are they

- Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every `Node` or `Bucket` has both a key, and a value.


# Terminology

  1- **Hash** - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
  
  2- **Buckets** - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
  
  3- **Collisions** - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.
