I have been living in this world for 23 years and 3 months. I am a passionate girl who had graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer science. My specific passion is in **Data**, That is why I had a *Data Analytics and Visualization* course contains (SQL / T-SQL, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, and Power BI) as soon as I graduated, and for some reasons I like Web development and that led me to be enrolled in **ASAC** to get myself ready for the web universe.

I know about Machine learning algorithms such as: Bagging and Backpropagation, and those both algorithms were the main part of my graduation project which was about *Voice classification* and *data mining.* Also, I got to know about *JAVA programing language* and the basics of *HTML, CSS, and Javascript.*
