*I have been living in this world for 23 years and 3 months. I am a passionate girl who had graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer science. My specific passion is in **Data**, That is why I had a Data Analytics and Visualization course as soon as I graduated, and for some reasons I like Web development and that led me to be enrolled in ASAC to get myself ready for the web universe.*

*I know about Machine learning algorithms such as: Bagging and Backpropagation, and those both algorithms were the main part of my graduation project which was about Voice classification and data mining.*
*Also, I got to know about JAVA programing language and the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.*
