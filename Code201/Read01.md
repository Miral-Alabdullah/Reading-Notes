**Why do we use the HTML?**


Before we head into the answer. take a look at the picture down below:

What do you see in that picture? 

**I will tell you:**


* That picture shows some details of newspaper samples.


What are these details?

* Heading
* Section 
* Banner
* Article
* Index
* Headline

AND so on, **BUT** 

Why do we talk about this stuff? what these details have to do with the HTML? 


> Simply, these details are the structure of the newspaper just like the HTML is the structure of the webpage.

> Think of your webpage as a page of a newspaper and you have to build the structure of it to be displayed in a standard way.

## OKAY! But how do we build this structure?

We have to write a code to structure the webpage. This code must be contained characters that live inside angled brackets that called elements and these elements are made of two tags; opening and closing tags.

According to the picture above, we can say that head and body are elements each one of them has a different purpose of usage, but these elements can be also more described with extra details.


## HOW?

> " Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. " (1)


> **" Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. "** (2)

## NOW


let's get deep into the HTML


* <mark>Here is a cheat sheet to help understand the elements clear</mark>



| Code-element       | Meaning                                                                                              |

| ``ID Attribute``   | It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page  (4)                    |
| ``Class Attribute``| It is like ID but it can be applied on more than one element                                         |
| ``Block elements`` | A block-level element always starts on a new line (e.g: lists)                                       |
| ``inline elements``| Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line (e.g: `<b></b>`) (5)                    |

| ``<div>``          | Defines a specific section in the web page, it used as a container for HTML elements                  |

| ``<nav>``          | It means the block inside of it includes hyperlinks                                              |
| ``<footer>``       | Contains the copyrights, the contacts information, and more                                           |
| ``<iframe>``       | Like a little window that has been cut into your page                                                |
| ``<meta>``         | Contains information about the webpage                                                               |

Before we reach the level of coding to structre the web page, we have to wireframe the image that we wantedto get in the final result. 

## Why do we have to? 

Simply, because you have to understand what you are going to do, what is the purpose of this web site and what is the content should be displayed on it. 

### Plus,
> You have to do site maps in order to get the professional structure, and the hierarchy that will help you go step-by-step **(Being organized)**.
