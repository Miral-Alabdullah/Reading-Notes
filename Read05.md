# Comparison AND Logical operators: 

> ## Comparison operators : 

>![comparsion!](https://cdn.javascripttutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/JavaScript-Comparison-Operators.png)
* It compare between a value and what is that value might be to return a single value.
* It return either **TRUE** or **FALSE**.
>> ### Types of these operators : 
* Is equal to (==) It compares the values not the Data types of these values. 
* Strict equal to (===) It compares the values and the Data types of these values. 
* Is not equal to (!=) It checks between two values if one of them is not equal to the other (It has nothing to do with the Datatype).
* Strict not equal to (!==) It checks between two values if one of them is not equal to the other including the Datatype.
* Greater than (>) It checks if the right value is greater than the left one.
* Less than (<) It checks if the right value is grless than the left one.
* Greater than or equal (>=) It checks if the right value is greater than the left one or if they both equal.
* Less than or equal (<=) It checks if the right value is grless than the left one or if they both equal.

> ## Logical operators :

* It compares between the results of more than one comparison operator.
* It return either **TRUE** or **FALSE**.
 >> ### Types of these operators :
 * Logical and (&&) If both expressions evaluate as true then the final result will be true.
 * Logical or (||) At least one expression should evaluate to true to get true as a final result.
 * Logical not (!) It negates the value, If it is true then will turn it into false and verse vice.

# Loops : 
>![Looping!](https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/prog101-2.jpg)
* It checks a condition firstly then it will execute the code block as soon as the condition evaluates true, once it gives false then the loop will stop checking/executing.

>> ### Types of loops:
* **For** : The condition in this type of looping will be a counter that counts numbers; It will execute the code as many as the counter counts [for (i= 0 _Initial value where it have to start from_ ; i<5 _The condition that keeps checking according to it's value_ ; i++> _The counter and it can be counted incrementally or decrementally_)].
* **While** : This type of looping has nothing to do with the counting, as soon as the condition is true the code will be executed.
* **Do..While** : It is pretty much like while instead of executing the statement in the curly braces at least once even if the condition is false.

>>> * A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.
